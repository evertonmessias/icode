Extends the default search with relevance, jet speed and ability to search any posts, metadata, taxonomy, shortcode content and any piece of the wordpress data. No external software/service required.

== Description ==

This plugin extends the standard search capabilities of Wordpress by creating a transparent word-based index. This allows you to quickly search not only by the title and content of posts, but also by meta-fields, custom types of posts, shortcode content and even by the contents of the attached files. Yes, all this is possible!

WPFTS does not require the installation of external indexing software and therefore works even on shared hostings. It does not require any refinement of your site, thus all other plugins will also automatically use the word-based index after installing the WPFTS.

You will be able to justify the relevance function by specifying the weights for the title, the content, and each of the meta-fields in your posts.

Unlike other search plug-ins, WPFTS does not replace the standard WP search, instead, it significantly expands its functionality. Thus, all built-in functions of WP_Query are saved, in addition, other plug-ins begin to use advanced search automatically.

There is a built-in Live Search functionality. You can simple switch it ON simple by using WPFTS's native flexible Search Widget. The custom search widget can be installed to any place of your page/post with a special shortcode ([wpfts_widget]).

The extended (pro) version of the plugin allows you to automatically index the text content of the attached files (for example, PDF files, full list of supported files is listed in Documentation) and perform a quick search on them.

Here is a short summary of capabilities in this FREE version:

* TRUE indexed text search within title, content, shortcodes, meta field values or programmatically-created text data
* Dramatically extends the native Wordpress search (and at the same time works via WP_Query())
* Supports phrase search (gives a relevance bonus for phrases)
* Supports multisite
* Supports powerful index clustering system (to assign different relevance weights to different parts of the post)
* Supports AND and OR logic 
* Ordering results by relevance, date, post ID, title, slug, type, random, comment_count
* Free version does not require 3rd-party libraries or services, everything happen inside your website!
* Displays search results like Google does (it shows sentences with queried words and highlighting them, check screenshots below)
* Supports Live Search (you can see the list of search results right in the search input box!)
* Works well on shared hostings
* Supports language translations (English, Deutch, Russian and Ukrainian are ready now)
* Removes HTML tags and comments from post content before indexing it (useful for Gutenberg-driven sites)
* Does the text search inside the shortcode content
* A TRUE relevance algorithm is used (improved TF-IDF)
* Relevance formula can be justified via settings (post title, content and each meta field can have different weights)
* Make default search WP ordering configurable (very useful for WP site search via ?s=<query>)
* It has API and full documentation to customize plugin's behaviour
* Works well with PHP 5.6+ to PHP 7.4+
* Supports add-ons, we have a big library of them, and you can write your own extensions, it's simple.

Please note, the [PRO](https://fulltextsearch.org/buy/ "WP FullText Search Pro plugin") version of this plugin also supports:

* File attachments search by their content (PDF, DOC, DOCX and other files currently supported)
* Filter file search by filetype
* Display file content in search results using Smart Excerpts
* External service to extract text information from files can be used (license included)
* Technical support (with installing, configuring, fixing conflicts)
* Regular automatic updates (it works the same way as WP repository updates)
* A bunch of add-ons which makes it possible to index and search the content and files generated by other plugins and themes (for example: file search add-on for Wordpress Download Manager plugin, add-on for Filebase Pro, add-on for Delicious Downloads, and many more). Pro user may ask us to build a custom add-on for their own websites.
