"\t\t<p>Everything is ready to index the contents of your site. When creating "
"a Search Index, the plugin will use its own tables in the database, no your "

"\t\t<p>The process may take a long time (it depends on the amount of data on "
"the site) and the site may work a little slower. There is no reason to worry "
"- this slowness will end with the end of the indexing process. To reduce the "
"time to build the index, please <b>do not close</b> the plugin settings page."
"</p>\n"
"\t\t<p>If you didn’t install WPFTS Add-ons and didn’t set up your own <code>"
"wpfts_index_post</code> hook, then this time only the Titles and the main "
"Content of the publications will be included in the index. If you want other "
"data to participate in the search (such as <b>post meta data</b>), now is "
