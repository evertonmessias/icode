"\t\t<p>First of all, thank you for your support by purchasing the copy of "
"the WPFTS plugin. Thus you are supporting the plugin development and the "
"whole Open Source code movement!</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t<p>Before the first launch, please do the following:</p>\n"
"\t\t<ul>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>1. <span style=\"color:red;\"><b>Enter your license number</b>"
"</span> in the \"<a href=\"/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpfts-options-"
"licensing\">Licensing</a>\" tab to ensure that you receive the latest "
"updates and the correct processing of files for placement from the search "
"index.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>2. Check the indexing settings in the \"<a href=\"/wp-admin/admin."
"php?page=wpfts-options-indexing-engine\">Indexing</a>\" tab. You can "
"configure something, but if you don’t understand how to do it right, leave "
"it as it is for now.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>3. Start building the index by clicking the big button below.</li>"
"\n"
"\t\t</ul>\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t<p>Usually, building an index is required only once, because the plugin "
"will automatically update it after the changes that you make on the site.</p>"
"\n"
"\t\t<p>The indexing process may take a long time (it depends on the amount "
"of data on the site) and the site may work a little slower. There is no "
"reason to worry - this slowness will end with the end of the indexing "
"process. To reduce the time to build the index, please <b>do not close</b> "
"the plugin settings page.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t<p>If you didn’t install WPFTS Add-ons and didn’t set up your own <code>"
"wpfts_index_post</code> hook, then this time only the Titles and the main "
"Content of the publications will be included in the index. If you want other "
"data to participate in the search (such as <b>post meta data</b>), now is "
"the time to read the <a href=\"%s\" target=\"_blank\">WPFTS Documentation</a>"
" and make the necessary changes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t<p>We wish you a pleasant work with the WP FullText Search plugin.</p>\n"
